# Linked Lists and the List Interface

### Previously, on CSC 143

**Linked Lists** are a type of data structure that stores a sequence of elements chained together using references (pointers).

Unlike the ArrayList, which uses an Array as a backing container to store elements contiguously and has `O(1)` indexing,
the Linked List has `O(n)` indexing as the list must be traversed.

However, the Linked List has the advantage of `O(1)` insertion and deletion,
whereas the ArrayList has `O(n)` insertion and deletion due to the need to shift elements.

A Linked List is composed of several "node" instances for every element in the list, storing a value and pointer to the next element.

We can *abstract* away the complexity of node management by writing a Linked List class which manages nodes,
and exposes easy-to-use public methods like `size()` that mask the underlying implementation.

A consequence of *abstraction* is that runtime and memory cost of operations are hidden to the client.
As an engineer, the choice of data structure used can have a significant impact on the performance of your program. 

## Linked List Algorithms

Linked Lists are provide several interesting algorithmic opportunities, which are implemented
quite differently than with ArrayLists.

These problems are also commonly found as technical interview questions.
